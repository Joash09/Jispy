# Creating my own Lisp language

In an effort to learn how programming languages are actually designed, I stumbled across this free [https://buildyourownlisp.com](book) which I thought is worth replicating. This repo is a clone of this project with modifications from me where possible.

# Personal Notes

### Chapter 5

Natural languages are build up of repeated substructures. Examples of these structures include combining nouns with "and" or describing an object by placing an adjective before the noun (e.g. grey cat). Languages therefore can be described as a infinite set of rules referred to as "re-write" structures. These rules form the grammar of a language. Programming languages also have grammar which define whether input from the use makes sense. To define the grammar of a programming language we will make use of a <em>parser</em>. 

Personally, I feel like there is a resemblence to first order logic; a subject which I've been meaning to delve deeper into.
